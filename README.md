# Fall2018_IS457_Introduction_to_Data_Science
This repository contains my submissions for the course assignments. It contains three folders **Code**, **Data** and **Reports**. 

As the course used **R** for the data analysis, most of the contents in the **Code** folder is in **R**. The **Data** folder contains files used or generated by the **R** code and **Report** are the final documents submitted.

Feel free to make any changes any suggest any improvements. :smile:
